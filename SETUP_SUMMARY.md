# ✅ CARSA Setup Scripts - Complete Package

I've created a comprehensive setup system for your CARSA Solana project that handles everything from contract deployment to frontend configuration. Here's what's been added:

## 🎯 Main Setup Scripts

### 1. `setup.sh` - Master Setup Script
**The main entry point for project setup**
- ✅ Checks all dependencies (Solana CLI, Anchor, Node.js, etc.)
- ⚙️ Configures Solana for devnet/mainnet/localnet
- 🏗️ Builds and deploys smart contracts
- 🪙 Initializes LOKAL token on the chosen network
- 🎨 Sets up frontend environment variables
- 📁 Copies contract types to frontend

**Usage:**
```bash
./setup.sh                    # Deploy to devnet (default)
./setup.sh --network devnet   # Deploy to devnet explicitly
./setup.sh --network localnet # Deploy to local validator
./setup.sh --help            # Show help
```

### 2. `redeploy.sh` - Quick Development Redeploy
**For rapid development iterations**
- 🔨 Rebuilds contracts quickly
- 🚀 Redeploys to specified network
- 📋 Updates frontend types
- ⚡ Optimized for frequent use during development

**Usage:**
```bash
./redeploy.sh devnet    # Redeploy to devnet
./redeploy.sh localnet  # Redeploy to local validator
```

### 3. `dev.sh` - Development Environment Manager
**Starts your development environment**
- 🖥️ Can start local Solana validator
- 🎨 Starts frontend development server
- 🔧 Manages background processes
- 🛑 Clean shutdown with Ctrl+C

**Usage:**
```bash
./dev.sh                    # Start frontend only (uses devnet)
./dev.sh --local-validator  # Start local validator + frontend
./dev.sh --no-frontend      # Setup only, no dev server
```

### 4. `token-manager.sh` - Enhanced Token Management
**Updated for multi-network support**
- 🪙 Check token information and supply
- 💰 Check wallet balances
- 🎯 Mint tokens to specific wallets
- 📊 List all token holders
- 🌐 Works with devnet/mainnet/localnet

**Usage:**
```bash
./token-manager.sh info                           # Show token info
./token-manager.sh balance <wallet_address>       # Check balance
./token-manager.sh mint <wallet_address> <amount> # Mint tokens
```

## 📚 Documentation

### 5. `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive Documentation
- 📋 Complete prerequisites list with installation commands
- 🚀 Quick start instructions
- 🛠️ Development workflow guidance
- 🔧 Configuration explanations
- 🆘 Troubleshooting section
- 📚 Additional resources

### 6. `Makefile` - Developer-Friendly Commands
**Convenient shortcuts for all operations**

**Common commands:**
```bash
make setup          # Complete project setup
make dev            # Start development environment
make redeploy       # Quick contract redeploy
make test           # Run contract tests
make clean          # Clean build artifacts
make status         # Show project status
make quickstart     # Complete setup + start dev environment
```

**Token management:**
```bash
make token-info                                    # Show token info
make token-balance WALLET=<address>               # Check balance
make token-mint WALLET=<address> AMOUNT=<amount>  # Mint tokens
```

**Utility commands:**
```bash
make airdrop        # Request SOL airdrop
make wallet         # Show current wallet
make balance        # Show SOL balance
make logs           # Show program logs
```

## 🔧 Key Features

### ✨ Multi-Network Support
- **Devnet** (default): Safe testing environment with free SOL
- **Localnet**: Local validator for offline development
- **Mainnet**: Production deployment (use with caution)

### 🛡️ Error Handling & Safety
- Dependency validation before setup
- Network-specific configurations
- Graceful error handling and cleanup
- Clear error messages with solutions

### 🎯 Developer Experience
- One-command setup: `./setup.sh`
- Quick iterations: `./redeploy.sh`
- Convenient shortcuts: `make <command>`
- Comprehensive documentation
- Status monitoring and debugging tools

### 📁 Automatic Configuration
- Frontend environment variables auto-generated
- Contract addresses saved and loaded
- Network-specific RPC endpoints
- Wallet integration setup

## 🚀 Getting Started

**For new developers:**
```bash
# Option 1: Use the setup script
./setup.sh

# Option 2: Use make (even simpler)
make quickstart
```

**For daily development:**
```bash
# Make contract changes, then:
make redeploy

# Start development environment:
make dev
```

## 📂 Generated Files

The setup process creates/updates these important files:
- `carsa-contracts/lokal-token-addresses.json` - Contract addresses
- `carsa-frontend/.env.local` - Environment variables
- `carsa-frontend/src/types/anchor/carsa.ts` - Contract types
- Various Solana keypair files

## 🎉 What This Enables

With these scripts, your team can:
1. **Onboard new developers in minutes** with `./setup.sh`
2. **Iterate quickly** during development with `./redeploy.sh`
3. **Test locally** with `./dev.sh --local-validator`
4. **Deploy to production** safely with network flags
5. **Manage tokens easily** with built-in utilities
6. **Debug efficiently** with status and logging tools

The entire setup is production-ready and follows Solana best practices while maintaining developer-friendly workflows.
