üß© 1. System architecture overview
Layer	Responsibility
Frontend (DApp)	Detects when the user earns voucher tokens ‚Üí prompts a one-time Approve transaction granting the staking pool delegate authority to transfer up to N tokens from the user‚Äôs ATA.
Backend / Worker	Monitors user token balances + allowances. When allowance > 0, executes delegated Transfer from the user‚Äôs ATA ‚Üí pool vault. Then swaps those tokens to SOL/WSOL and deposits them into a yield pool or stake-pool contract.
Smart Contract (Program)	‚ë† Manages pool state (vault ATA, pool authority PDA). ‚ë° Receives voucher tokens. ‚ë¢ Optionally swaps or stakes them. ‚ë£ Updates pool state (total staked, user records). ‚ë§ Emits events for the frontend to refresh UI.
Solana Runtime + Stake Pool Program	Handles real staking, rewards, and validator delegation.
‚öôÔ∏è 2. Smart contract (Anchor) ‚Äî what functions it needs

The contract is lightweight because the heavy staking work can be delegated to the SPL Stake Pool program.
Example module outline:

// programs/voucher_pool/src/lib.rs
#[program]
pub mod voucher_pool {
    use super::*;

    // one-time init by the pool admin
    pub fn initialize_pool(ctx: Context<InitializePool>, config: PoolConfig) -> Result<()> {
        // create & save PoolState PDA, set vault ATA, sToken mint, etc.
    }

    // called by the backend delegate (pool authority) when pulling user tokens
    pub fn deposit_voucher(ctx: Context<DepositVoucher>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
        // verify PDA signer == pool_delegate
        // transfer voucher tokens from user_ata -> vault_ata
        // update pool_state.total_voucher += amount;
        // emit event: VoucherDeposited { user, amount }
    }

    // optional: record yield updates / conversion
    pub fn record_yield(ctx: Context<RecordYield>, sol_amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
        // update accounting: total_sol_staked, reward_index, etc.
    }

    // optional: redemption logic
    pub fn redeem(ctx: Context<Redeem>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
        // burn voucher tokens from user if needed
        // transfer back SOL equivalent from pool vault
    }
}

Key accounts for deposit_voucher
Account	Role
user	signer of initial Approve instruction (off-chain; not required here)
user_voucher_ata	source token account (owner = user)
pool_vault_ata	destination token account (owner = pool PDA)
pool_state	PDA storing totals
token_program	SPL Token program ID

Because the user previously executed Approve(pool_delegate, amount), the backend can call this instruction signed only by the pool delegate key.

üß≠ 3. Frontend flow (non-custodial UX)
Step-by-step

Mint voucher tokens

After a purchase, your backend mints SPL voucher tokens to the user‚Äôs ATA.

Return the transaction ID to the frontend so it can show the receipt.

Prompt for delegate approval

import { createApproveInstruction } from '@solana/spl-token';

const approveIx = createApproveInstruction(
    userVoucherAta,
    POOL_DELEGATE_PUBKEY,
    wallet.publicKey,
    BigInt(voucherAmount)
);
const tx = new Transaction().add(approveIx);
await wallet.sendTransaction(tx, connection);


User signs once; gives the pool delegate the right to move up to voucherAmount tokens.

Backend worker watches

Subscribes to TokenAccount changes or uses a webhook (Helius / RPC logs).

When allowance > 0, sends a deposit_voucher instruction to the on-chain program, signed by the pool delegate.

Smart contract handles deposit

Transfers tokens from the user ATA to the pool vault ATA.

Emits an event ‚Üí your indexer / frontend listens and updates UI: ‚ÄúYour voucher has been auto-staked.‚Äù

Optional auto-swap + stake

Backend executes an off-chain instruction sequence:
swap voucher ‚Üí WSOL via DEX aggregator ‚Üí deposit WSOL into an SPL Stake Pool.

Updates record_yield to keep accounting consistent.

Frontend display

Queries getAccountInfo(pool_state) and shows user‚Äôs ‚Äústaked balance‚Äù and estimated yield.

Provides a ‚ÄúRevoke Delegate‚Äù button for user safety:

const revokeIx = createRevokeInstruction(userVoucherAta, wallet.publicKey);

ü§ñ 4. Copilot-ready prompt example

Paste this into your IDE‚Äôs Copilot chat or README to auto-generate scaffolding:

Prompt:
‚ÄúGenerate a Solana Anchor program named voucher_pool that implements non-custodial voucher staking.
Requirements:

Initialize pool (PDA state + vault ATA)

deposit_voucher instruction that transfers SPL tokens from user ATA to vault ATA using delegate authority (user has approved it).

Maintain total_voucher_staked in state and emit VoucherDeposited events.

Include Anchor IDL and TypeScript client examples calling initialize_pool and deposit_voucher.

The frontend uses @solana/web3.js and @solana/spl-token to request an Approve instruction and later a Revoke.

Use Devnet defaults.‚Äù

This prompt will let Copilot scaffold your lib.rs, schema.rs, and minimal JS client automatically.

üîê 5. Security & best practices

Always limit the Approve amount (e.g., only what‚Äôs just been minted).

Encourage users to revoke approvals after use.

Use PDAs instead of raw keypairs for pool authority.

On Devnet, test every step with small balances and simulate reward accrual.

Log and verify every transaction signature on the backend before marking tokens ‚Äústaked.‚Äù
